### My story
I became fascinated with computers and web development in 1997 while I was attending NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public service. 
My first job after graduate school was working as a web technical producer for [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/ "CNET"). I became very interested in cybersecurity and digital forensics in 2014.
Since then, I have pursued different educational and work opportunities to become an expert in the field of cybersecurity.
